# Information Model

# Description
This project contains the modelling language for Device abstractions, which are created by various Technology Adapters. It is used to decouple real devices from their Data Consumer Adapter implementations. Concrete interface implementations can be found in [Information Model Manager](https://git.hahn-schickard.de/hahn-schickard/software-sollutions/application-engineering/internal/opc_ua_dev_group/gateway-project/information-model-manager) project.

This project is used in [Technology Adapter Interface](https://git.hahn-schickard.de/hahn-schickard/software-sollutions/application-engineering/internal/opc_ua_dev_group/gateway-project/technology-adapter-interface) and [Data Consumer Adapter Interface](https://git.hahn-schickard.de/hahn-schickard/software-sollutions/application-engineering/internal/opc_ua_dev_group/gateway-project/data-consumer-adapter-interface)
